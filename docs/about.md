`SPARK` is for statistical method for identifying spatial expression patterns. SPARK directly models raw count data generated from various spatial resolved transcriptomic techniques. With a new efficient penalized quasi-likelihood based algorithm, SPARK is scalable to data sets with tens of thousands of genes measured on tens of thousands of samples. 

Importantly, SPARK relies on newly developed statistical formulas for hypothesis testing, producing well-calibrated p-values and yielding high statistical power. We illustrate the benefits of SPARK through extensive simulations and in-depth analysis of four published spatially resolved transcriptomic data sets. In the real data applications, SPARK is to 10-fold more powerful than existing approaches and identifies new genes that reveal the importance of neuronal migration in the formation of the olfactory system as well as the importance of immune system and cytoskeleton stability in tumor progression and metastasis.
