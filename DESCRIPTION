Description: SPARK is an efficient tool for identifying spatial expression patterns. SPARK directly models raw count data generated from various spatial resolved transcriptomic techniques. With a new efficient penalized quasi-likelihood based algorithm, SPARK is scalable to data sets with tens of thousands of genes measured on thousands of samples. Build upon a non-parametric framework, SPARK-X is scalable to large-scale data sets with tens of thousands of genes measured on hundred thousands of samples.
